# üìò **SpeedReader AOT Virtual Mapping System (v1.2)**

### *‚ÄúZero-latency, base-12 precision: parse once, prove safety, run forever.‚Äù*

---

## 1. Executive Summary

SpeedReader AOT is a **front-end optimized, Ahead-of-Time (AOT) virtual mapping system** built on **compressed dodecagram (base-12) intermediate opcodes (UCIO)**. It is designed as a **universal front-end layer** for programming language execution pipelines, compilers, and verifiers, with extreme emphasis on **determinism, safety, speed, and auditability**.

This system is not a toy‚Äîit is an **engineered stack** with:

* **Complete grammar-driven front end** (LL(1) predictive parser, zero backtracking).
* **Universal Common Intermediate Opcodes (UCIO)**: compact, unambiguous, base-12 encoded, machine-ready IR.
* **AOT verifier**: proves correctness, scope pairing, and bounded loop termination.
* **Optimizer/peephole packer**: folds constants, removes dead paths, and tightens immediates.
* **Virtual Machine**: executes UCIO directly with stack + lexical environments, closures, and mutability contracts.
* **C runtime integration**: native printing, math, and arena allocation for pipeline embedding.
* **Full toolchain CLI**: compile, optimize, verify, disassemble, run, and trace‚Äîall in one.

It is **production-ready, modular, and extensible**. Every file is implemented, every line executes, and the system is designed to serve as both a **research prototype** and a **deployable foundation** for next-generation compilers and interpreters.

## 2. Design Philosophy

### 2.1 Core Principles

* **Determinism First**: Every pathway is predictable, static, and safe. No backtracking, no ambiguity.
* **Proof by Construction**: Verification is not optional‚Äîit‚Äôs wired into the AOT pipeline.
* **Lossless Efficiency**: Zero-cost lookahead, no data loss in compression, and no semantic ambiguity.
* **Universal Interop**: UCIO acts as a **shared intermediate layer** across multiple languages or front ends.
* **Base-12 Encoding**: Harnessing a 144-opcode design (00..EE base-12) for compactness, orthogonality, and symbolic purity.

### 2.2 What Makes It Unique

* Combines **static translation tables** (FIRST-sets) with **dynamic deterministic execution**.
* Uses **ranged scoping markers** (`SCOPE_ENTER/EXIT`, `RANGE_BEGIN/END`) that are machine-verifiable.
* Built-in **hooks** allow plug-in protocol routines and scalable safety gates.
* Traceability: every IR emission can be tied back to its source span.

---

## 3. Architecture Overview

The system consists of **five major layers**:

1. **Lexer + Parser (Front-End)**

   * Grammar-driven LL(1) predictive parser.
   * Zero backtracking, FIRST-set disambiguation.
   * Emits UCIO instructions directly, with lineage markers.

2. **UCIO (Intermediate Representation)**

   * 144 compact opcodes encoded in base-12.
   * Supports control flow, arithmetic, functions, loops, scoping, hooks, and traces.
   * Encoded with signed-varints for immediates + tagged string tables.

3. **Verifier (AOT Proof Layer)**

   * Ensures **balanced scope/loop/if/range structures**.
   * Enforces **budget constraints**: print count, mutation count, loop fuel.
   * Proves **termination of range-for loops** from FOR\_HINT.
   * Rejects unsafe captures (non-global mutable captures disallowed).

4. **Optimizer/Peephole Packer**

   * Removes trivial ops (`NOP`, `TRACE_*`, `HOOK_*`).
   * Constant-folds arithmetic + comparisons.
   * Branch elimination: collapses constant conditions into live code only.
   * Packs immediates tighter, producing leaner blobs.

5. **Virtual Machine (UCIO Executor)**

   * Stack-based interpreter with **lexical frames**, **boxed mutables**, and **closure captures**.
   * Structural skipping for `IF` and `LOOP` (no fragile labels).
   * Supports shadowing, upvalues, CALL/RET, and runtime tracing.
   * Emits JSON trace logs for audits.

6. **Native Runtime (C)**

   * Arena allocator (`arena.c`).
   * Sample integration with native `print` and math.
   * Embeddable in larger pipelines for hybrid execution.

## 4. UCIO: Universal Common Intermediate Opcodes

### 4.1 Design

* **144 slots (00..EE base-12)**, giving coverage and room for expansion.
* Structured into categories: core, literals, control, scopes, loops, functions, hooks, ranges, traces.

### 4.2 Examples

* `LITERAL_I64 n`: push integer literal.
* `BIND_CONST name`: bind variable immutably.
* `BIND_MUT name`: bind variable mutably (boxed).
* `CALL fname argc`: call function with args.
* `FN_LABEL fname param_count params... captures...`: define function metadata.
* `FOR_HINT a b step inclusive`: structural hint for verifier to prove loop termination.
* `TRACE_MARK name span`: record lineage for audits.

---

## 5. Verifier: Safety by Proof

### 5.1 Structural Proofs

* Ensures all `SCOPE_ENTER`/`SCOPE_EXIT`, `RANGE_BEGIN`/`RANGE_END`, and `IF/LOOP` markers are balanced.
* Detects underflows and malformed structures.

### 5.2 Budgets

* **PRINT**: limit console output side effects.
* **MUTATE**: limit variable mutation events.
* **LOOP\_FUEL**: ensures loops without explicit range proofs terminate within a bound.

### 5.3 Range-For Proof

* `FOR_HINT` encodes loop bounds + step + inclusivity.
* Verifier computes iteration count statically.
* Rejects loops exceeding `LOOP_FUEL`.

---

## 6. Optimizer: Folding & Packing

### 6.1 Trivial Removal

* Strips NOPs, hooks, and traces.

### 6.2 Constant Folding

* Example:

  ```
  LITERAL_I64 3  
  LITERAL_I64 4  
  ADD  
  ```

  ‚Üí `LITERAL_I64 7`

### 6.3 Compare Folding

* Example:

  ```
  LITERAL_I64 5  
  LITERAL_I64 5  
  CMP_EQ  
  ```

  ‚Üí `LITERAL_I64 1`

### 6.4 Branch Elimination

* Constant conditions collapse `IF` blocks into a single live path.

---

## 7. Virtual Machine

### 7.1 Execution Model

* **Stack-based**: values flow through push/pop.
* **Lexical environments**: stacked dicts with shadowing.
* **Boxed mutables**: `[val]` ensures captures see updated values.

### 7.2 Features

* **Functions + Closures**: captures resolved by lexical search.
* **Loops**: structural skipping ensures correct execution.
* **Tracing**: every step can be logged with env + stack snapshots.
* **Error Handling**: VMError on malformed bytecode.

---

## 8. CLI Toolchain

### 8.1 Commands

* `compile`: build UCIO blob from source.
* `run`: execute directly.
* Options: `--opt`, `--verify`, `--disasm`, `--trace`.

### 8.2 Example

```bash
python3 -m speedreader.cli compile examples/closures_range.sr --opt --verify --disasm
python3 -m speedreader.cli run examples/closures_range.sr --opt --trace
```

---

## 9. Native Runtime (C)

* Arena allocator for deterministic memory reuse.
* Can be extended to provide syscalls, math libs, or file I/O.
* Demonstrates hybrid pipeline embedding.

---

## 10. Use Cases

* **Compiler Front Ends**: plug any syntax in, lower to UCIO.
* **Education & Research**: safe environment for proving loop termination.
* **Sandboxing**: budgets enforce side-effect caps.
* **Polyglot IR**: unify multiple languages through UCIO translation.
* **Audit Trails**: trace logs provide forensic execution replays.

---

## 11. Roadmap

* **Escape Analysis**: allow safe non-global captures.
* **Dead Store Elimination**: prune writes with no subsequent reads.
* **Advanced Propagation**: constant folding across blocks.
* **JIT/Hybrid Execution**: compile UCIO into LLVM/ASM for native speed.
* **Multi-Language Bridges**: embed UCIO as IR target for multiple compilers.

## 12. Conclusion

SpeedReader AOT v1.2 represents a **mature, production-ready execution pipeline** that unites deterministic parsing, proof-driven verification, safe closures, and base-12 universal opcodes. It is **modular, auditable, safe, and fast**‚Äîa foundation for future compilers, interpreters, and hybrid systems.

It‚Äôs not just an IR. It‚Äôs a **contract** between source, proof, and execution:
**‚ÄúParse once. Prove safety. Run forever.‚Äù**
